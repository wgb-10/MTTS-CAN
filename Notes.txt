Paper:

MTTS-CAN is an improvement to DeepPhys. Network completely based on 2D CNNs therfore takes only 6ms per frame. 
Potentially could be used for real-time HR measurement.

Experimental Setup:

During data acquisition, a multi-imager semicircular array (a total of 9 synchronized, visible spectrum imagers)
centered on the imaged participant in a controlled light environment was used to record the participantâ€™s head 
motions during specific tasks.

Each participant was recorded six times with increasing head motion in each task.

The six recordings were repeated twice in front of two backgrounds.



Questions:

In data_generator.py:

What is frame depth?    
Ans. Frame depth is the window size (number of adjacent frames)



Code (Given):

When running predict_vitals.py, the x-axis of graph obtained contains the number of frames. y-axis is wave amplitude
I think.

By looking at the code, I found out that the authors did preprocessing on the dataset outside the current code base. This included adding the 
video frames, labels (ground truth for each frame) and the frame normalization in a single matlab file for each video.

The files are then read using the h5py library.



Code (My Version):

Remember to always use my fork of the code.

Will work with only UBFC for now and if there's time, I'll use PURE.

The path to the ground truth will be what I already preprocessed from RemotePPG:
(D:\OneDrive\Documents\rPPG-Projects\Datasets-Preprocessed\UBFC2\DATASET_2)

The path to the videos will be my year 4 one drive: 
(D:\OneDrive - Heriot-Watt University\Computer Science Uni\Year 4\Datasets\UBFC_DATASET\DATASET_2)

Need to update the following functions from preprocess.py:

- get_nframe_video, split_subj, sort_video_list

Check if sort_video_list works.


Implementation:

When feeding data into the model, I'll map each frame to its corresponding row in the phys table (for UBFC). This 
will exhaust all frames, but some table entries won't have an associated frame (as table entries aka ground truth
is sampled at 30Hz whereas videos are less than 30FPS).
